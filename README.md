# A simple todo app built in Svelte and TypeScript
### Tut followed - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOI77E8Y95Q (Really good)

## Added a little bit extra after the tutorial video
- SVG icons to replace text 'delete' and 'edit' buttons
- An easter egg on the header
- Styled completely in my own CSS way(used some buttons online as a template and edited for myself)

### This is hard
- This is my first ever time writing Svelte or TypeScript(I'm also a beginner in JS).
- I understand it when I read it.
- I *kind of* understand it when I write it (sometimes I need help rearranging things)
- This was **EXTREMELY** fun to build!
